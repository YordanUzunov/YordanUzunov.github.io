                        <h2>Denmark to qualify for World Cup 2018</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        On Tuesday night, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark clash in their World Cup play-off second leg. The first leg produced a goalless draw, so it is winner takes it all in this one.

                        The Republic of Ireland will have been pleased to earn a goalless draw in the first leg, as Denmark have been in good form on home soil.

                        However, the draw should not have surprised anybody, as Ireland have lost just one of their last 12 games in World Cup qualifying. Their recent World Cup qualifiers have been tight affairs, with under 2.5 goals scored in their last eight outings.

                        Martin O’Neill’s side have a mixed record on home soil in World Cup qualifying. The home side have won three, drawn two and lost one of their last six qualifiers at the Aviva Stadium.

                        Like their recent qualifiers in general, their recent home World Cup qualifiers have been low scoring, with under 2.5 goals scored in their last five games.

                        Denmark heads into this crucial clash unbeaten in their last eight World Cup qualifiers. However, the Scandinavian side have now drawn their last two games in qualifying.

                        Their last three qualifiers have produced 2.5 goals. On paper that looks like a safe bet in this clash.

                        The visitors have a decent recent away record in qualifying, winning six of their last eight qualifiers, including their last three games in Kazakhstan, Armenia and Montenegro.

                        Denmark have also been relatively prolific in that eight-game run, scoring at least two goals in five of their last eight away qualifiers. The visitors have a decent defensive record too, as they have conceded just five goals in their last six away games in qualifying.

                        This game is unlikely to be high scoring and Ireland’s games tend to be tight. However, Forebet predicts that Denmark will have enough quality to win in Dublin and seal their place at World Cup 2018.

                        <h2>Senegal to finish World Cup qualifying with a win</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Senegal have already sealed their place at World Cup 2018 with a game to spare in Group D of the African section of qualifying. However, on Tuesday night they host already eliminated South Africa, as the home look to finish their campaign with a victory.

                        Senegal have not had it all their own way in Group D, as the home team have won three and drew two of their five outings so far. However, results elsewhere have helped Aliou Cisse’s side confirm their place at Russia 2018.

                        Last time out in qualifying Senegal pulled off a 2-0 win in South Africa to end the visitor’s hopes of qualification and seal their World Cup spot.

                        Senegal are now eight games unbeaten in World Cup qualification, having recorded four draws. Their last qualifying defeat was in 2013 when they suffered a 3-1 defeat against the Ivory Coast in Abidjan.

                        Senegal are now 20 games unbeaten on home soil in World Cup qualifying dating back to 2000.

                        South Africa have been poor in Group D of qualifying and currently sit bottom of the group with just three points. The visitors have lost four of their last five games in all competitions, while also losing three of their last four World Cup qualifiers.

                        South Africa have also conceded two or more goals in all three of their recent qualification outings. The visitor’s away form in World Cup qualifying has been inconsistent, but they have won just three of their last ten games on their travels.

                        Their recent World Cup qualifiers on the road have been high scoring, as four of their last five games have produced under 2.5 goals.

                        Although Senegal have already qualified for the World Cup they will be keen to finish the campaign with a victory. Forebet predicts they will do just that to heap more misery on the visitors.
